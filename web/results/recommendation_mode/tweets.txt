Query: Selection of jet clustering algorithms for event reconstruction at the reconstruction level, aimed at studying Higgs Self-Coupling at the XCC, an X-ray Free Electron Laser-based gamma-gamma Compton Collider Higgs Factory.

Recommendations:

[1] The XCC collider, designed for precision Higgs self-coupling studies, achieves a Higgs production rate of 80,000/year at 62.5 GeV photon collisions, matching the ILC at 250 GeV. Upgrading to 380 GeV doubles the ùõæùõæ‚ÜíHH cross-section compared to e+e- colliders at 500 GeV (arXiv:2306.10057).
