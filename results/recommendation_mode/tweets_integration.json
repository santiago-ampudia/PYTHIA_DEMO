  "query": "The repository features an integrated simulation-to-analysis pipeline that begins with the generation of Monte Carlo samples processed through the Delphes framework to simulate detector responses. This data is then transformed into ROOT format, encapsulating detailed event information, which is subsequently converted into CSV format for machine learning applications. The pipeline includes stages for data ingestion, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training using XGBoost, and evaluation, culminating in the computation of physical observables critical for theoretical and experimental physics research.",
