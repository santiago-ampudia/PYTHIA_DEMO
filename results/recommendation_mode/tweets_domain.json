  "query": "The repository addresses the domain of high-energy physics, focusing on di-Higgs boson production via photon-photon collisions at future circular colliders. It incorporates simulation methodologies reflective of contemporary collider experiment simulations, such as those for the SiD detector model, and adapts these to the specific challenges posed by gamma-gamma collisions. The research methodologies include the generation of Monte Carlo samples, detector simulation adaptations for high-luminosity pileup scenarios, and the statistical analysis of collider physics data.",
