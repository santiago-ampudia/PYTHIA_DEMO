  "query": "The repository is structured around a simulation-to-analysis workflow specifically designed for di-Higgs boson studies in photon-photon collisions at a hypothetical future circular collider. It integrates a fast detector simulation using the Delphes framework, tailored for the unique environmental and operational conditions of a gamma-gamma collider. The architecture supports complex event topologies and high-luminosity scenarios, facilitating the transition from raw simulation data to processed analysis-ready formats.",

    "Delphes 3.0 provides a fast and realistic simulation framework ideal for complex event topologies like those in di-Higgs studies at gamma-gamma colliders, supporting detailed modeling and parameterization of detector responses [1307.6346]. It's designed for easy integration into workflows, enhancing simulation efficiency without deep technical know-how [1307.6346].",
    "Exploring Higgs self-coupling in photon-photon collisions reveals that optimal collision energy is around 270 GeV for significant statistical sensitivity, crucial for future collider studies like those simulated in the repository [1205.5292]. This insight aids in the precise setting of simulation parameters for enhanced analysis accuracy [1205.5292].",
    "The repository can benefit from integrating findings on double Higgs production mechanisms from linear e+e- colliders, providing a comparative framework that enriches the understanding of photon-photon collision simulations [2411.01507]. These studies offer complementary insights into Higgs self-coupling, potentially different from gluon-gluon fusion processes, vital for refining simulation models [2411.01507].",
    "To manage high-luminosity scenarios in gamma-gamma colliders, leveraging advanced simulation tools that incorporate beam-induced background studies and detector interaction dynamics is essential [2503.20214]. These elements are crucial for realistic modeling and accurate reproduction of experimental conditions, which are central to the repository's objectives [2503.20214]."
