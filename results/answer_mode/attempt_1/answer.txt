Query: what is the production rate of the Higgs boson per year at the XCC, an X-ray FEL-based gamma gamma Compton Collider Higgs Factory

Answer: The X-ray FEL-based gamma gamma Compton Collider Higgs Factory (XCC) achieves a Higgs boson production rate of 80,000 Higgs bosons per 10^7 seconds per year at a center-of-mass energy of 125 GeV [2306.10057]. This production rate is achieved using 62.8 GeV electron beams colliding with 1 keV X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) beams to produce 62.5 GeV photon beams. The collider employs cold copper distributed coupling (C3) accelerator technology, which offers a sharply peaked gamma gamma center-of-mass energy spectrum, enhancing the efficiency of Higgs boson production [2306.10057]. Additionally, the XCC design allows for an upgrade to a center-of-mass energy of 380 GeV, potentially doubling the cross-section for gamma gamma -> HH compared to e+ e- -> ZHH at 500 GeV, which could further increase the Higgs production rate [2306.10057].
